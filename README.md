# Jerry-Pi
A simple bot written in python.

Jerry-Pi was designed to be used with a Raspberry-Pi and a 480x320px screen in mind. 
Currently the only features Jerry-Pi has are the following:
* Display current time
* Display current weather at a given location (via OpenWeatherMap)
* Display a discord message sent to the bot via the "!pi TEXT" command

More features are planned. :)
